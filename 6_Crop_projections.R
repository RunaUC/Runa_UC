# Crop global CMIP6 projections to the extent of the study area

# Notes -------------------------------------------------------------------

  # CMIP6 is the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which is in its sixth phase.
  # This repository, hosted by the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) archives model outputs by > 50 climate modelling groups from around the world.
  # Among the results archived is ScenarioMIP, which contains projections used by the IPCC in its Assessment Reports. CMIP6 was used in the recent IPCC Sixth Assessment Report
  # Dave downloaded daily data from 9 models and regridded them to a common 0.25ยบ grid using bilinear interpolation, with missing cells filled by nearest neighbour.
  # For each model, historical data and projections were downloaded.
  # Historical data were cropped to start in 1982.
  # Projections for ssp119, ssp126, ssp245, ssp370 and ssp585 were spliced to the end of the historical data to make daily timeseries running from 1982-2100.
  # Each dataset was then masked using a common land mask, so that only data over the ocean remain.
